View patches or pipe various Mercurial diff output to vim and see changesets, files, and hunks folded nicely together.

Some examples:
       hg in --patch | vim -
       hg diff | vim -
       hg diff -r 12 -r 13 | vim -
       hg export -r 12: | vim -
       hg log --patch src\somefile.cpp | vim -

Right now, this pretty much just works with Mercurial diff output.  Because Hg can use Git style patches, it does work with some Git output but it is not 100% reliable or useful.

Eventually, I hope to make this work with more version control systems and just about anything that can produce unified diff output.

This plugin has also been made into a pathogen bundle and can be installed with an 'hg clone https://bitbucket.org/thetoast/diff-fold' in your pathogen bundle folder.
In the future, the pathogen bundle may be more up-to-date, but any major updates will be made available here.
