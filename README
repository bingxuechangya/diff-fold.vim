This is a fork of [vimscript #3262](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3262), [original](https://bitbucket.org/thetoast/diff-fold) by Ryan Mechelke.

The original Mercurial-centric version has been extended to also support different version control systems equally well. Minor improvements have been made, and the script is used (and occasionally improved) by the new maintainer.

Open (or pipe) various (Git, Mercurial, Subversion...) diff outputs to vim and see changesets, files, and hunks folded nicely together.

### Examples

    hg in --patch | vim -
    git diff | vim -
    hg diff -r 12 -r 13 | vim -
    hg export -r 12: > 12.patch; vim 12.patch
    hg log --patch src\somefile.cpp | vim -
