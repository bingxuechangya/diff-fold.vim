View patches or pipe various Mercurial diff output to vim and see changesets, files, and hunks folded nicely together.

Some examples:
       hg in --patch | vim - -c "setlocal ft=diff"
       hg diff | gvim -
       hg diff -r 12 -r 13 | vim -

Right now, this pretty much just works with Mercurial diff output.  Because Hg can use Git style patches, it does work with some Git output but it is not 100% reliable or useful.

Eventually, I hope to make this work with more version control systems and just about anything that can produce unified diff output.

The script can also be found on my bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/thetoast/vimstuff
